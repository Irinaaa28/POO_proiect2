# Barbie Dress Up Minigame Concept

## Introduction
I have adopted and implemented the concept of "Barbie Dress Up" games, a very popular game among browser users, which has brought happiness to many girls during their childhood. 
## How does the code behind this minigame look like?
Long story short, I used plenty of classes to distinguish every piece of clothing, to represent the Barbie doll and to face possible errors. Here are the steps:
* I created an interface called "Wardrobe" where to start the whole code;
* I created an abstract class called "Garment", which represents a general piece of clothing. Each variable in the "Garment" class consists of a code and a color; 
* Using the principle of inheritance, I created four derived classes from the "Garment" class, representing different types of clothing: "Blouse", "Dress", "Pants" and "Skirt".
* In order to prevent the game from ending due to an eventual error, I considered and implemented some classes for all possible errors;
* Then, I created a class called "Barbie", which represents the Barbie doll itself. Through the "Barbie" class, we upgrade her physical appearance by repeatedly adding and removing various clothes.
## What do these classes contain?
Within these classes I implemented:
* different void functions for describing, adding and removing clothes
* default constructors
* getters
* setters
* operator=
* copy constructors
* operator<<
* operator>>
* move constructors
* move assignment operators
* destructors.
For the error claases, I only wrote a default constructor where to show the text for every error.
## Is there anything else besides classes in the game?
Of course. I implemented void functions to remove clothes, to change all the letters from a word in small ones and to show Barbie's final look.
## Ok, but how does the main look like?
Firstly, I added default blouses, dresses, skirts and pants which to dress up Barbie with. The main code is a really interactive one, because you can add and remove clothes by your preference. When you decide finishing the game, there will be showed Barbie's final look.
